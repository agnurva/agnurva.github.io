      <description>Recently, I attended an interview for the role of a Data/Dimensional modeller for a services company in Bangalore. Though I have designed and build Information Systems(IS) based on Relational DataBase Management System(RDBMS), Today I primilarily work on Visualiztion and Analytics solution based on Big Data technologies. I though of quickly brushing up on the traditional way of managing information. I was too lazy to find and read those old chunky books on databases and so I started with youtube and followed up with couple of links on Google looking out for definitions, laws and design guidelines used in Data Modelling.</description>
